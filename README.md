- My name is Rushia, I'm 16 years old. My house is in the northern section of Akihabara, where all the weebs are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for Hololive, I'm at home everyday. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I never sleep. After having beer and doing no stretches before going live, I usually have a lot of problem streaming. Just like a baby, I stream screaming and shouting. I was told, I am pettan. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who is boing boing. I take care not to trouble myself with any pettan comments, like winning and losing, that would cause me to start screaming. That is how I deal with the pettan comments, and I know that is why I am boing boing. Although, if I were to kill I wouldn't miss the mark. Basically, fandead, you are a troublesome thing that would hinder my stream, therefor my enemy, Deadly Queen... is what I've named it. I'm going to kill you now before you have a chance to speak, so I can go back streaming.
